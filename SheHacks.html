            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <ul>
                We are a non-profit online service bridging the gap between food waste and food security. Inspired by France’s 2016 ban on food waste, we network food establishments and food banks to allow for a convenient process for establishments to share their excess food. Food waste that end up in landfills contribute to greenhouse gas emissions while lack of fresh food is detrimental to health. Our ultimate goal is to aid low-income families decrease their economic and physical limitations to food security.

        <h2> FAQ from Donors </h2>
        <p> <i>Will I be liable for illnesses resulting from consumption of my donations? </i>


<br/> <br/> No, the Donation of Food Act (1994) states that “a person who donates food or who distributes donated food to another person is not liable for damages resulting from injuries or death caused by the consumption of the food unless,
         (a) the food was adulterated, rotten or otherwise unfit for human consumption; and
         (b) in donating or distributing the food, the person intended to injure or to cause the death of the recipient of the food or acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others. 1994, c. 19, s. 1 (1). </li>

        <br/> <br/> <i>Do I need to drop off the food? </i> 
<br/> <br/> No, it is not necessary for donors to drop off the food. Food banks will be contacting you to arrange a pick up time. </br>

        <br/><i>Can food past their best before date be donated? </i>
<br/> <br/> Yes! “Best before does not mean throw away after.” Use your best judgement; if you would not eat it yourself, it should not be donated. </br>

        <br/><i> What kinds of food can I donate? </i>
<br/> <br/> Any type of food can be donated; not limited to non-perishable items! </br>
